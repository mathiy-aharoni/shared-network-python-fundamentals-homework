# --- Make Some Pizzas ---

# 1. Create a list called 'toppings' with the following:
# "pepperoni", "pineapple", "cheese", "sausage", "olives", "anchovies", "mushrooms"


# 2. Create a list called 'prices' with the following integer values:
# 2, 6, 1, 3, 2, 7, 2


# 3. Count the number of occurrences of 2 in the 'prices' list.
# Store the result in a variable called num_two_dollar_slices and print it.


# 4. Find the length of the 'toppings' list and store it in num_pizzas.


# 5. Print the string: "We sell [num_pizzas] different kinds of pizza!"
#  where [num_pizzas] represents the value of our variable num_pizzas.


# 6. Create a 2D list called 'pizza_and_prices' where each sublist is [price, topping].
# Use this data:
#
# Price | Topping
# ------------------
# 2     | "pepperoni"
# 6     | "pineapple"
# 1     | "cheese"
# 3     | "sausage"
# 2     | "olives"
# 7     | "anchovies"
# 2     | "mushrooms"
#
# For this new list make sure the prices come before the topping name like so: [price, topping_name]

# 7. Print pizza_and_prices.


# --- Sorting and Slicing Pizzas ---

# 8. Sort pizza_and_prices in ascending order by price.


# 9. Store the first element of pizza_and_prices in a variable called cheapest_pizza.


# 10. A man walks into the pizza store and shouts “I will have your MOST EXPENSIVE pizza!”
# Get the last item of the pizza_and_prices list and store it in a variable called priciest_pizza.


# 11. It looks like the most expensive pizza from the previous step was our very last 
# "anchovies" slice. Remove it from our pizza_and_prices list since the man bought the last 
# slice.


# 12. Since there is no longer an "anchovies" pizza, you want to add a new topping called 
# "peppers" to keep your customers excited about new toppings. Here is what your new topping 
# looks like:
# [2.5, "peppers"]

# Add the new peppers pizza topping to our list pizza_and_prices.

# Note: Make sure to position it relative to the rest of the sorted data in pizza_and_prices, otherwise our data will not be correctly sorted anymore!


# 13. Three mice walk into the store. They don’t have much money (they’re mice), 
# but they do each want different pizzas.
# Slice the pizza_and_prices list and store the 3 lowest cost pizzas in a list called 
# three_cheapest.


# 14. Print the three_cheapest list.
